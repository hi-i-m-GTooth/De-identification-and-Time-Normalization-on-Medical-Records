The left submandibular lymph node shows widespread follicular hyperplasia and expansion of germinal centres with prominent tingible body macrophages. Flow cytometry showsa reactive mixed population of T and B lymphocytes. The overall morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical pattern of staining favours a reactive lymphoid (follicular) hyperplasia. However, the presence of extranodal lymphocytic inflammation, as well as, irregular expansion of some of the enlarged hyperplastic follicles is considered atypical. The case will be sent to Dr Bruno (Flowserv) for her expert opinion and a supplementary report will be issued.

The left submandibular lymph node shows widespread follicular hyperplasia and expansion of germinal centres with prominent tingible body macrophages. Flow cytometry showsa reactive mixed population of T and B lymphocytes. The overall morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical pattern of staining favours a reactive lymphoid (follicular) hyperplasia. However, the presence of extranodal lymphocytic inflammation, as well as, irregular expansion of some of the enlarged hyperplastic follicles is considered atypical. The case will be sent to Dr Bruno (Pfizer Inc) for her expert opinion and a supplementary report will be issued.

The tumour appearances are similar to the previous biopsy specimen reviewed from 28/2/2066 (Washington Mutual Inc report 29R30720).
The left submandibular lymph node shows widespread follicular hyperplasia and expansion of germinal centres with prominent tingible body macrophages. Flow cytometry showsa reactive mixed population of T and B lymphocytes. The overall morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical pattern of staining favours a reactive lymphoid (follicular) hyperplasia. However, the presence of extranodal lymphocytic inflammation, as well as, irregular expansion of some of the enlarged hyperplastic follicles is considered atypical. The case will be sent to Dr Bruno (Washington Post) for her expert opinion and a supplementary report will be issued.

The left submandibular lymph node shows widespread follicular hyperplasia and expansion of germinal centres with prominent tingible body macrophages. Flow cytometry showsa reactive mixed population of T and B lymphocytes. The overall morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical pattern of staining favours a reactive lymphoid (follicular) hyperplasia. However, the presence of extranodal lymphocytic inflammation, as well as, irregular expansion of some of the enlarged hyperplastic follicles is considered atypical. The case will be sent to Dr Bruno (McCormick & Company) for her expert opinion and a supplementary report will be issued.

The left submandibular lymph node shows widespread follicular hyperplasia and expansion of germinal centres with prominent tingible body macrophages. Flow cytometry showsa reactive mixed population of T and B lymphocytes. The overall morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical pattern of staining favours a reactive lymphoid (follicular) hyperplasia. However, the presence of extranodal lymphocytic inflammation, as well as, irregular expansion of some of the enlarged hyperplastic follicles is considered atypical. The case will be sent to Dr Bruno (Oshkosh Truck) for her expert opinion and a supplementary report will be issued.
